## General info
The purpose of this project is to build a workout log app with a very minimalistic design in order
to emphasize the most essential components of a workout app, namely the date, the targeted muscle groups,
the exercises, the weight and repetitions for each workout set, as well as a timer to keep track of breaks in between sets. 

As an avid gym goer and fitness enthusiast, I was motivated to build this app when I started looking for workout logging apps 
that were very simple and rudimentary in function and deisgn. Most apps that I would come across would have a myriad of customizable options 
and would have you select from a number of pre-determined workouts or exercises, which was nice but it wasn't quite what I was looking for. 
What I wanted to achieve was the freedom to name my own workouts/muscle groups/exercises without having to choose from a limited list of options. 
I also wanted to avoid cluttering the UI as much as possible, which is why I kept the UI simple and to the point.
